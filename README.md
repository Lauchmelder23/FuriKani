# FuriKani

A chrome extension to remove furigana from websites based on your WaniKani level.

## Installation
This extension is not on the web store (yet). Download the repo and go to your extensions page in chrome (`chrome://extensions`). Enable the developer mode and add the root folder of this project as an unpacked extension.

## How to use
Click the extension icon in your extension bar and enter a WaniKani API Token into the field. Then click "Download Data". That's it, the extension will now remove furigana of any vocab you (should) know.

There are known issues that I'm working on fixing.
